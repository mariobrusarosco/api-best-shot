# Unit Testing Phase Plan

## Objective

Implement comprehensive unit testing for the API Best Shot project to improve code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring.

## Tasks

### Framework Setup (Completed)

- [x] Select and install testing framework and tools

  - Selected Jest with ts-jest for TypeScript support
  - Added supertest for API endpoint testing
  - Configured Jest globals and types

- [x] Create testing configuration files

  - Created jest.config.js with TypeScript support
  - Added jest.setup.js for environment configuration
  - Updated .eslintignore for test config files

- [x] Establish test directory structure
  - Tests are co-located with source files
  - Following `*.test.ts` naming convention
  - Maintaining domain-driven directory structure

### Test Implementation (In Progress)

- [x] Write initial test examples

  - Created health endpoint tests
  - Implemented error handling patterns
  - Demonstrated proper test structure

- [ ] Create test helper utilities

  - Need test database utilities
  - Need authentication helpers
  - Need request mocking utilities

- [x] Implement test coverage reporting
  - Configured in jest.config.js
  - Set coverage thresholds (70%)
  - Excluding appropriate files

### Integration and Documentation

- [ ] Setup CI integration for tests

  - Add test job to CI pipeline
  - Configure test caching
  - Set up test result reporting

- [ ] Document testing practices
  - Update testing guide with examples
  - Document mocking strategies
  - Add troubleshooting section

## Next Steps

1. Create test helpers for common operations
2. Add tests for authentication endpoints
3. Add tests for database operations
4. Set up CI integration
5. Complete documentation with real examples
