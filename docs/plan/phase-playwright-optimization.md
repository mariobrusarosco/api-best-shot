# Phase: Playwright Architecture Optimization

## üéØ **Context & Problem Statement**

Currently, the `/api/v2/data-provider/tournaments/create` endpoint uses Playwright for asset fetching, which creates several challenges:

- **Resource Intensive**: Each request spawns a full Chromium browser (50-100MB memory)
- **Memory Leaks**: Browser instances not properly cleaned up (fixed recently)
- **Performance**: 3-5 second response times per asset fetch
- **Scalability**: Poor scaling due to browser overhead
- **Necessity**: Required due to SofaScore's anti-bot protection mechanisms

## üõ°Ô∏è **Why Playwright is Necessary**

SofaScore implements sophisticated anti-bot protection:

- ‚ùå Blocks simple HTTP requests (Axios fails)
- ‚úÖ Requires real browser environment
- ‚úÖ Needs JavaScript execution context
- ‚úÖ Must have proper browser fingerprints

## üöÄ **Solution Approaches**

### **Approach 1: Browser Instance Pooling** (Immediate)

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days
- **Benefits**: Reuse browser instances, reduce startup overhead

### **Approach 2: Google Cloud Functions** (Recommended)

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Impact**: Very High
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Benefits**: Serverless scaling, resource isolation, clean architecture

### **Approach 3: Dedicated Asset Microservice** (Long-term)

- **Complexity**: High
- **Impact**: Very High
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Benefits**: Specialized service, independent scaling, better monitoring

### **Approach 4: Third-Party Scraping Service** (Alternative)

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days
- **Benefits**: Outsourced complexity, proven reliability

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (Week 1)**

#### Task 1.1: Implement Browser Pooling

- [x] Create `PlaywrightPool` class with connection management

- [ ] Create performance dashboard

#### Task 3.2: Optimization Fine-tuning

- [ ] Analyze performance data
- [ ] Optimize Cloud Function configurations
- [ ] Implement additional caching if needed
- [ ] Fine-tune retry/timeout settings

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Comparison**

| Approach            | Memory Usage | Response Time | Scalability | Complexity | Cost     |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Current**         | 50-100MB     | 3-5s          | Poor        | Low        | High     |
| **Browser Pool**    | 15-30MB      | 1-2s          | Better      | Low        | Medium   |
| **Cloud Functions** | 5-15MB       | 0.5-2s        | Excellent   | Medium     | Low      |
| **Microservice**    | 10-20MB      | 0.3-1s        | Excellent   | High       | Medium   |
| **Third-Party**     | 1-5MB        | 0.2-1s        | Excellent   | Low        | Variable |

## üìä **Success Metrics**
