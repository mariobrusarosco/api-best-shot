Hi!

How's your current knowledge of @api-best-shot project?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the files shared, I have a good understanding of the api-best-shot project. Let me summarize the key aspects:

1. **Project Structure & Architecture**
- It's a Node.js/TypeScript API project using Express
- Follows a domain-driven design with a three-layer architecture (Query, Service, API layers)
- Uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database management
- Has Docker configuration for development environment

2. **Environment Setup**
- Uses multiple environment configurations (.env.demo, .env.production)
- Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL and environment initialization
- Has a setup script that creates necessary environment variables

3. **Development Tools**
- Uses TypeScript
- Has ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Includes Drizzle for database migrations
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD and database migrations

4. **Key Features**
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database migrations and schema management
- AWS integration (S3, Scheduler)
- Error tracking and performance monitoring
- Authentication system (JWT based)
- CORS configuration

5. **Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Database migrations guide
- Routing system documentation
- Services architecture documentation

6. **Deployment**
- Uses Railway for hosting
- Has separate configurations for demo and production environments
- Includes GitHub Actions workflows for different environments

The project appears to be a well-structured API service with proper development practices, documentation, and deployment configurations. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect?

Before that, let's say next week I have to open a new Cursor Composer. Will you lost the anaylyzis?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I will lose my analysis of the project if you open a new Cursor Composer next week. Each conversation is independent, and I don't maintain state or memory between sessions.

To help with this, I recommend:

1. Keep important documentation in the project files (like you already do with the docs/ folder)

2. When starting a new session, you can:
   - Share the key files again
   - Or provide a brief summary of what we were working on
   - Or reference specific documentation files that are relevant to our discussion

3. For complex changes or discussions, it's good practice to:
   - Document decisions in the project
   - Update README.md or relevant docs
   - Create detailed commit messages

Would you like to discuss any specific aspect of the project or start working on a particular task?

_**User**_

Can I mention previous Discussion from old Composers to a new Composer?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, I won't be able to access or understand discussions from previous Cursor Composer sessions. Each conversation starts fresh, and I can only work with the information you provide in the current session.

When starting a new session, you'll need to:

1. Share relevant files and context
2. Explain what was previously discussed/decided if it's relevant
3. Be specific about what you want to accomplish in the new session

Think of each Cursor Composer session like talking to a new person who is very knowledgeable about programming but has no history of your previous conversations. They'll need context about your specific project and requirements.

For example, if we make important decisions in this session and you want to reference them next week, you would need to:
- Document them in your project files
- Or summarize the key points when starting the new session
- Or share relevant files/commits that contain the context

Would you like to start working on something specific with the api-best-shot project?
