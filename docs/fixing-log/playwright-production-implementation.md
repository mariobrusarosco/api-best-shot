# Playwright Production Implementation

## Issue Context

Our data provider v2 API relies on Playwright with Chromium for web scraping to collect football data. While this works well in our development environment, deploying this functionality to production on Railway.com presented several challenges:

1. Playwright requires specific system dependencies to run headless browsers
2. Resource allocation and browser arguments needed optimization for container environments
3. Error handling and retries were insufficient for production stability
4. No health check existed to verify Playwright functionality
5. Browser paths and executable locations varied between environments

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

### 1. Docker Configuration

After initial attempts to manually configure dependencies, we switched to the official Microsoft Playwright Docker image:

- Used `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.42.1-jammy` as our base image
- Eliminated need for manual dependency installation
- All browser binaries pre-configured correctly

### 2. BaseScraper Enhancements

- Added retry mechanism for network requests with exponential backoff
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Optimized browser arguments for containerized environments
- Reduced viewport size to minimize memory usage
- Added proper resource cleanup

### 3. Health Check API

- Implemented a dedicated Playwright health check endpoint
- The endpoint tests browser creation to confirm functionality
- Provides detailed status information for monitoring

### 4. Documentation

- Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for Playwright deployment
- Developed a comprehensive developer guide for Playwright in production
- Added deployment configuration for Railway.com

## Results

These improvements ensure:

1. Reliable operation of web scraping in production
2. Better error handling and recovery from transient issues
3. Proper resource management to prevent memory leaks
4. Ability to monitor Playwright functionality through health checks
