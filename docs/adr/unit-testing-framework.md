# ADR: Unit Testing Framework Selection

## Context

The API Best Shot project requires a comprehensive unit testing solution to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development.

## Decision

We will use Jest as our primary testing framework with the following supporting libraries:

- **Jest**: Main testing framework providing test runner, assertions, and mocking capabilities
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript support for Jest
- **supertest**: For HTTP endpoint testing
- **testcontainers**: For database integration tests (optional)

## Rationale

- Jest provides an all-in-one solution (test runner, assertion library, mocking)
- Strong TypeScript support through ts-jest
- Built-in code coverage reporting
- Large community and extensive documentation
- Works well with Express.js applications
- Familiar to many developers

## Consequences

- Need to configure Jest for TypeScript
- May require additional setup for database testing
- Will need to integrate with our CI pipeline
