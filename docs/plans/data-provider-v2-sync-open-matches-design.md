# Data Provider V2: Sync Open Matches Design

## Goal

Define the first concrete V2 workflow to implement:

`sync-open-matches`

This document translates the V2 ADR into an actionable design for the first use case, without writing code yet.

## Why This Is The First Workflow

`sync-open-matches` is the right first V2 workflow because:

1. it is the current operational pain point
2. it exercises the SofaScore request path directly
3. it needs the full operation envelope:
   - execution job
   - report
   - Slack notification
4. it requires a stable provider error contract
5. it is the workflow currently producing noisy logs and unclear summaries

## Hard Constraints

These are fixed for this workflow:

1. **Playwright is mandatory**
   - Direct non-browser `fetch()` to SofaScore is a known `403` path.
   - Match-event requests must run in browser context through Playwright.
2. **Execution jobs are tournament-scoped**
   - A tournament’s open-match sync results must be traceable under that tournament in admin.
3. **Every tournament operation must upload a report**
4. **Every tournament operation must send Slack notifications**
5. **V2 must not import anything from `src/domains/data-provider/**`**

## Scope

In scope:

1. query due open SofaScore matches
2. group them by tournament
3. fetch provider match data through Playwright
4. classify outcomes with stable contracts
5. persist match updates
6. persist tournament-scoped execution jobs
7. upload per-tournament reports
8. send per-tournament Slack notifications
9. return batch-level summary for scheduler use

Out of scope:

1. schema redesign for match polling state
2. suppression/recovery workflow for provider-missing matches
3. standings refresh redesign
4. direct single-match update V2
5. rounds/teams/standings/tournament V2 workflows

## Key Design Decision

The scheduler-triggered workflow is **batch-scoped**, but the operational unit is **tournament-scoped**.

That means:

1. scheduler runs one batch
2. batch finds due matches across tournaments
3. batch groups matches by `tournamentId`
4. each tournament group becomes one independent V2 operation
5. each tournament operation creates:
   - one execution job
   - one report
   - one Slack notification lifecycle

This is the only design that matches the current admin monitoring requirement.

## Runtime Architecture

### 1. Transport Layer

Recommended shape:

- `PlaywrightRuntime`
  - owns browser startup/shutdown
- `BrowserSession`
  - one isolated page/context per tournament operation
- `BrowserRequest`
  - generic browser-context JSON request primitive

Important rule:

- The transport layer must not know what a match is.
- It only knows how to execute browser-context requests safely.

### 2. SofaScore Provider Layer

Recommended shape:

- `SofaScoreEndpoints`
  - builds event URL from `matchExternalId`
- `SofaScoreMatchProvider`
  - requests event payload through `BrowserRequest`
  - returns normalized provider data
  - throws structured provider request errors

Important rule:

- This layer knows SofaScore.
- It does not know cron semantics, admin semantics, or tournament execution-job semantics.

### 3. Use-Case Layer

Recommended shape:

- `runOpenMatchSyncBatch`
  - orchestration entrypoint for scheduler
  - groups matches by tournament
  - invokes one tournament operation per group
- `runTournamentOpenMatchSync`
  - core tournament-scoped workflow
  - processes all due matches for one tournament

### 4. Operations Layer

Recommended shape:

- `TournamentOperationRunner`
  - creates execution job
  - runs tournament use case
  - uploads report
  - completes/fails execution job
  - sends Slack notification

This layer guarantees the operational contract.

## Core Flow

### Batch Flow

```text
scheduler cron target
-> runOpenMatchSyncBatch
-> query due open matches
-> group by tournamentId
-> for each tournament group:
   -> TournamentOperationRunner.run(...)
-> return batch summary
```

### Tournament Flow

```text
create execution job
-> create isolated browser session
-> for each due match in tournament:
   -> fetch SofaScore event through provider layer
   -> classify outcome
   -> persist when needed
   -> collect summary/details
-> upload report
-> complete or fail execution job
-> send Slack notification
```

## Query and Grouping Rules

The batch entrypoint should query due matches using a V2 persistence adapter backed by the existing match domain query layer.

Required fields per match:

1. `id`
2. `externalId`
3. `tournamentId`
4. `roundSlug`
5. `provider`
6. `date`
7. `status`

Batch grouping rule:

- `group by tournamentId`

If a due match is missing `tournamentId`:

1. do not process it in V2 tournament flow
2. record it in batch-level invalid input summary
3. do not create a tournament-scoped execution job for it

## Provider Contract

The provider layer should expose a method like:

```ts
fetchMatchEvent(input: { matchExternalId: string; session: BrowserSession }): Promise<SofaScoreMatchEventPayload>
```

Behavior:

1. build `https://www.sofascore.com/api/v1/event/{matchExternalId}`
2. execute request in browser context through Playwright
3. parse JSON
4. throw structured `ProviderRequestError` on non-OK responses or malformed provider payloads

## Error Contract

The workflow needs stable error types at minimum:

1. `TransportError`
2. `ProviderRequestError`
3. `PersistenceError`
4. `OpenMatchSyncError`

`ProviderRequestError` must carry:

1. `provider`
2. `requestUrl`
3. `requestIdentifier`
4. `status` when known
5. `cause` when available

Example:

```ts
type ProviderRequestError = Error & {
  provider: 'sofascore';
  requestUrl: string;
  requestIdentifier: string;
  status?: number;
  cause?: unknown;
};
```

String parsing such as:

```ts
error.message.includes('Received status 404')
```

is explicitly forbidden in V2.

## Match Outcome Classification

For `sync-open-matches`, the use case should classify each match into one of these outcomes:

1. `updated`
2. `provider_status_not_ended`
3. `provider_response_missing_event`
4. `provider_match_not_found`
5. `unexpected_failure`

Recommended rules:

### `updated`

- provider returned event
- mapped status is `ended`
- DB update succeeded

### `provider_status_not_ended`

- provider returned event
- mapped status is not `ended`
- this is not an error

### `provider_response_missing_event`

- provider response is syntactically successful
- expected `event` payload is missing
- this is operationally notable, but not a transport failure

### `provider_match_not_found`

- provider returned `404`
- this is expected for this workflow
- this must not be logged as an application error

### `unexpected_failure`

- non-404 provider error
- malformed provider response that breaks normalization
- persistence failure
- unexpected runtime error

## Persistence Rules

This workflow uses the current database shape.

That means:

1. ended matches update scores/status through the existing match polling update path
2. non-ended matches may still update `lastCheckedAt` through the current checked-at mechanism
3. `provider_match_not_found` must **not** update `lastCheckedAt`

Known limitation:

- this preserves the current polling-state debt until a separate schema redesign happens

## Execution Job Contract

Each tournament operation must create one execution job row with:

1. `requestId`
2. `tournamentId`
3. `operationType`
4. `status = in_progress`
5. `startedAt`

Recommended operation type:

`matches_sync_open_v2`

Reason:

1. explicit separation from V1 during coexistence
2. works with the current execution schema because `operationType` is free text

On completion/failure, the job must store:

1. `status`
2. `completedAt`
3. `duration`
4. `reportFileUrl`
5. `reportFileKey`
6. `summary`

## Summary Contract

The execution-job summary must remain compatible with the current admin UI expectation while adding richer V2 data.

The current admin UI reads:

1. `totalOperations`
2. `successfulOperations`
3. `failedOperations`

Therefore V2 summary must include at minimum:

```ts
{
  totalOperations: number;
  successfulOperations: number;
  failedOperations: number;
  scannedMatches: number;
  updatedMatches: number;
  openMatches: number;
  endedMatches: number;
  providerNotFoundMatches: number;
  providerMissingEventMatches: number;
  unexpectedFailureMatches: number;
}
```

Recommended interpretation:

1. `totalOperations` = number of matches processed in that tournament operation
2. `successfulOperations` = matches processed without unexpected failure
3. `failedOperations` = matches classified as `unexpected_failure`

Expected-provider outcomes such as `provider_match_not_found` count as processed, not failed.

## Report Contract

Each tournament operation must produce a detailed uploaded report.

The report should contain:

1. operation metadata
2. tournament metadata
3. execution timing
4. summary counts
5. per-match detail lines

Recommended detail buckets:

1. `updated`
2. `providerStatusNotEnded`
3. `providerResponseMissingEvent`
4. `providerMatchNotFound`
5. `unexpectedFailures`

Each detail record should include when available:

1. `matchId`
2. `externalId`
3. `roundSlug`
4. `requestUrl`
5. `providerStatus`
6. `reason`
7. `errorMessage`

## Slack Contract

Slack notification belongs to the tournament operation envelope, not the provider layer.

Slack message should include:

1. tournament label
2. operation type
3. final status
4. compact counts from summary
5. report URL
6. request ID

Expected provider misses must not produce failure notifications by themselves.
Only tournament operations with `unexpected_failure` outcomes should fail.

## Logging Rules

Logging should follow these rules:

1. expected provider `404` is not an error log
2. provider `404` gets recorded in the report details and summary counts
3. unexpected provider/persistence/runtime failures are error logs with structured metadata
4. batch-level scheduler output should summarize tournament operations, not dump raw internal objects

## Playwright Session Strategy

Recommended strategy:

1. create one browser runtime per batch invocation
2. create one isolated session/context per tournament operation
3. close each tournament session after its operation completes
4. close the batch runtime after all tournament operations complete

Why:

1. lower browser-launch overhead than one browser per tournament
2. better isolation than sharing one page/context across all tournaments
3. clean boundary for tournament-scoped execution jobs and reports

## Integration Point With Scheduler

The scheduler should not know provider details.

It should only call a V2 batch entrypoint, for example:

`runOpenMatchSyncBatch()`

The batch entrypoint returns a scheduler-facing summary such as:

1. tournaments processed
2. tournaments succeeded
3. tournaments failed
4. tournaments refreshed
5. invalid matches skipped

This summary is for scheduler logs only.  
Detailed operational visibility remains in execution jobs and uploaded reports.

## Explicit Non-Goals

This design does not solve:

1. long-term polling-state redesign
2. direct single-match update V2
3. standings refresh V2
4. admin UI redesign
5. queue-based parallelization

## Next Step

Before implementation, produce one final execution plan for this workflow only:

1. exact file list
2. exact interfaces
3. implementation order
4. cut points for review after each step
