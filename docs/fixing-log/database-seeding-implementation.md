# Database Seeding Implementation

## Context

We needed a consistent way to seed the database with initial data (members) for both local development and the demo environment. A key requirement was having a remote triggering mechanism for the demo database.

## Approach

1. **Simplified Seeding Strategy**

   - Created a single script `scripts/seed-db.ts` that handles member seeding
   - Made the script idempotent by checking for existing records before insertion
   - Implemented environment detection to handle both local and demo environments

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**

   - Created a workflow file `.github/workflows/seed-demo-db.yml`
   - Added a manual trigger with confirmation to prevent accidental runs
   - Configured to use the existing `DB_STRING_CONNECTION_DEMO` secret for consistency with migration workflows

3. **Package.json Commands**
   - Added `db:seed` for local development
   - Added `db:seed:demo` for the demo environment

## Key Considerations

1. **Aligned with Existing Patterns**

   - Used the same environment variable naming as the migrations workflow
   - Followed the existing database connection methodology
   - Maintained compatibility with the smart database connection management

2. **Security**
   - Stored sensitive connection strings in GitHub Secrets
   - Added confirmation step to prevent accidental seeding

## Future Expansion

The system is designed to be easily expandable to seed additional entities (tournaments, rounds, etc.) when needed by extending the `scripts/seed-db.ts` file.
